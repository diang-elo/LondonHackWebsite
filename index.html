    <h3 class="title">WHAT THE LACK OF RECYLCING HAS DONE:</h3>
    <p>
        The amount of waste produced by our society has harmful effects on the environment. By not recycling our waste products, 
        we produce harmful carbon dioxide gases and create unnecessary garbage.
        There is a shortage of materials for the people who care to recycle, and an absence of education for the people who do not.

    <h3 class="title">Our Mission</h3>
    <p>The average American generates about 4.5 pounds of waste each day. 
        Only 1.5 pounds of it is recycled or composted. This means that over an average lifetime of 78.7 years, one American would send 67,000 pounds of waste to landfills.
    Our mission is to cut that percentage down by 30% over the next 10 years.<b> And How Will We Do That?</b></p>

        <h4>Partnering With Corporations</h4>
        <p>We strive to partner with parent companies such as Green Toys, AllBirds, Rothy's, WeWood, and Cotopaxi to repurpose your recycled goods.
            While producing 100-percent recycled goods may be a tall order, it’s never too late to start down a path towards sustainability.

        <h4>Incentivising Recycling</h4>
        <p>Most Americans are confused about recycling, and the crisis driven by China’s decision to stop accepting most foreign scrap material is worsening the problem. 
            At this point it’s hard to be sure that items put in the recycling bin are recycled. Thats why we want to reward you for making a change. For each Item you donate you will be awarded with vouchers which you can 
        use at places such as H&M, Nike, Adidas, etc. You will also be entered in monthly giveways which the chance to win hundreds of dollars in gift card and prizes</p>

        <h4>Make It Easy To Recycle</h4>
        <p>We are trying to make it easier for the younger generation to recycle for a good cause, Our plan for the next ten years is to work with schools, postal offices, and garbage facilities
            to use them as a collection post for all your donations to us. all you have to do is scan your items and a notification with notfy where you can drop off your items, its as easy as ordering.

      <li>
        
        <h4>We Want To Be The Change</h4>
        <p>Our one goal is to change how Americans and the world see recycling. We want to show them the results of what recycling can do and why repurposed things are just as good as brand new items.
            Not only are you saving money for yourself, your saving the earth and keeping it well run for the next generation.
